Capture Face Data: You can use a library like OpenCV to capture the face image from the webcam or a video feed. You can then use face detection algorithms like Haar cascades or deep learning-based models like Dlib's face detector to detect and extract faces from the captured image.
Generate ID: Once you have the face image, you can use face recognition algorithms like Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, or Deep Face Recognition to generate a unique ID for each person. You can store this ID along with the corresponding face image and a time deadline for authentication.
Authentication: For authentication purposes, you can compare the captured face with the stored face data using face recognition algorithms. If a match is found, you can authenticate the user based on the stored ID and time deadline.
Various Applications: You can create different sections in your application to handle different authentication purposes. For example, you can have a section for login, access control, or attendance tracking. Each section can use the stored ID for authentication by comparing it with the captured face.
